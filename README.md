# nested-CSS-Grid-and-Flexbox-Playground

<p>I have created a nested-CSS-Grid-and-Flexbox-Playground as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate a nested scenario using just HTML & CSS for layout as well as to improve my understanding of CSS Grids and Flexboxes.</p>

<p>This repo contains an Angular application which includes multiple layouts using different combinations of CSS Grid and Flexbox.</p>

<p>The products and payments columns of the first 2 layouts currently do wrap on small viewports. However, their parent container does not currently wrap on a small viewport. Also, the product and payment item details columnn widths need attention.</p>

<p>In light of those issues, it does respond fairly well on a small viewport. This is a work-in-progress that I will update as I find the time to do so. </p>


>**Note:** One of the limitations with CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1 is that Grid items must be direct children of the grid container. 

Pull Requests are welcome!!!

>**Note:** The optimal solution for this scenario may be to utilize the CSS Grid ‘subgrid’, which is a feature is the main addition to [CSS Grid Layout Module Level 2]. Unfortunately, it is at the Working Draft stage at this time. ( https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-2/#valdef-display-subgrid)
